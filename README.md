# unit-4-game

Crystal Collector game:

The goal of the game is to match the random number by clicking on the 4 crystals.
Each crystal is also assigned a random number at the beginning of each round.
You must click on the crystal to find out what that number is.
You win by matching your score to the "Number to Match" exactly.
If the score is below the "Number to Match", the game will continue
If the score is over the "Number to Match", you'll receive a loss for that round.
If the score either equals or exceeds the "Number to Match", an new round will begin and a win or loss will be added.
If you'd like to start over with a clean slate, click the "Restart" button at the bottom.
